<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-html52-20171214/">Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating
<u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
</p>

<p>
The first line defines what type of contents the document contains.
"<!doctype html>" means the page is written in HTML5. Properly formatted
HTML pages should include <html>, <head>, and <body> tags, which are all
included in the example above. The page title, metadata, and links to
referenced files are placed between the <head> tags. The actual contents
of the page go between the <body> tags.

<img src = "coding.jpg" width = "50%">
<p>
The web has gone through many changes over the past few decades, but HTML has
always been the fundamental language used to develop webpages.
Interestingly, while websites have become more advanced and interactive,
HTML has actually gotten simpler. If you compare the source of an HTML5 page
with a similar page written in HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0, the HTML5 page would
probably contain less code. This is because modern HTML relies on cascading
style sheets or JavaScript to format nearly all the elements within a page.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: Many dynamic websites generate webpages on-the-fly, using a server-side
scripting language like PHP or ASP. However, even dynamic pages must be
formatted using HTML. Therefore, scripting languages often generate the HTML
that is sent to your web browser.
